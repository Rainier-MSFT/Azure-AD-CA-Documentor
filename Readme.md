This PowerShell script documents your Azure AD Conditional Access policies. The script exports all data as a csv file which can be pretty formatted as excel workbook.

1. Install this script from the PowerShell gallery (dependent modules are automatically installed):

    * ```Install-Script -Name Invoke-ConditionalAccessDocumentation -Scope CurrentUser```
    
    * Script is saved to the user's default script lcoation: ```"C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Scripts"```
    
2. Connect to Microsoft Graph

    * Grant initial admin consent: ```Connect-Graph -Scopes "Application.Read.All", "Group.Read.All", "Policy.Read.All", "RoleManagement.Read.Directory", "User.Read.All" -ContextScope Process```
    
    * You can also connect to Microsoft Graph Beta endpoint with `Select-MgProfile -Name "Beta"`, this will also export policies with preview features like workload identities
    
    * After initial admin consent has been granted you can connect with: ```Connect-Graph```
    
3. Run script via PowerShell dot sourcing
    
    * ```& "C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Scripts\Invoke-ConditionalAccessDocumentation.ps1"```
    
4. (Optional) Pretty format the csv with excel & save it as excel workbook
